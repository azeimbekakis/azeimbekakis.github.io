<p>
    The Coronavirus pandemic began in early 2020 and continues to impact the world at the time of writing. 
    Without a developed vaccine throughout 2020, governments resorted to various measures in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus. 
    Examples of these measures include school closings, travel bans, stimulus checks, social distancing guidelines, contact tracing, and masking policies. 
    As vaccines began to roll out at the turn of 2021, many of these responses loosened as the world took steps towards normalcy. 
    With a critical eye on the responses to the pandemic, it will be important to know which policies were most effective in combating spread of the virus. 
    In the event of another pandemic in the future, governments around the world can utilize this information to implement effective policies that will keep as many people alive as possible. 
    This analysis uses LOWESS and linear regression on the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker dataset in an attempt to show which policies may have been the most impactful.
